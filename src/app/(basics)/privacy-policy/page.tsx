                <p className="font-light leading-relaxed py-2">
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                    applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
                    activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
                    online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
                    uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
                    signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
                    DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                    communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
                    online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
                    inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
